# Component Playbook

[`docs/adr/0001-s2-styling-source-of-truth.md`](../../docs/adr/0001-s2-styling-source-of-truth.md)
first.

## Checklist

1. Start from the real React Spectrum S2 component as the source of truth.
2. If the Solid side does not have that component yet, port it into
   `@proyecto-viviana/solid-spectrum` across the full stack before comparing.
3. If the Solid side already has the component, compare it against the React
   reference and close the gap.
4. Implement styling through the S2-compatible style system.
5. Review the S2 source before implementing. Port real S2 wrapper structure,
   slots, state logic, derived render-state, overlay behavior, and temporal
   behavior when it exists; do not assume the component is only a headless
   reskin. Trace helper hooks and delayed state transitions into the final style
   call.
6. Do not add or tune app-local Spectrum component CSS.
7. If the Solid component is not migrated, mark it missing/gap.
8. Match S2 props and TypeScript names in controls and fixtures.
9. Cover light and dark themes.
10. Cover component-specific states before screenshots. For time-based states,
    verify the delayed visible phase and any derived disabled-like styling the
    source uses to normalize variants.
11. Compare DOM slots, state attributes, computed styles, geometry, behavior, and
    screenshots.
12. Commit snapshots only after the React and Solid implementations are both the
    intended references.

## Validation Plan First

Before touching component code, write the component-specific validation plan.
This can live in the issue, PR notes, or the visual state matrix, but it must be
specific enough that implementation assumptions are testable.

Include:

- React S2 component and source files reviewed.
- Props, slots, wrapper structure, provider/context behavior, and generated style
  declarations to port.
- Static states to compare: default, variants, sizes, disabled/read-only,
  validation, density, static color, and slot/content permutations.
- Interaction states to compare: hover, focus-visible, pressed, selected/open,
  keyboard navigation, dismissal, and focus return.
- Temporal states to compare: pending/loading delays, spinner visibility,
  press-scale transforms, overlay animation frames, and delayed state
  normalization.
- Geometry checks to run before screenshots: root box, slot boxes, icon box,
  text box, centerline delta, baseline-sensitive text/icon alignment, and
  overlay placement.
- Which checks are behavior assertions, computed-style assertions,
  Playwright CLI inspection artifacts, and committed Playwright test snapshots.

Use this matrix shape before implementation. Expand rows until every risky prop,
slot, state, or layout assumption has an explicit validation target:

| Assumption        | React S2 reference to inspect                       | Solid surface to inspect   | Browser check                             | Committed guard                                |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Default geometry  | root/slot/icon/text boxes                           | root/slot/icon/text boxes  | Playwright snapshot plus box measurements | visual or computed Playwright spec             |
| Interaction state | selected/pressed/open/focused attributes and styles | same attributes and styles | click/keyboard/hover flow in browser      | behavior assertion and screenshot where visual |
| Temporal state    | delayed pending/loading/animation frame             | same delayed phase         | video/trace or timed snapshot             | Playwright assertion after delay               |

Do not start coding from a generic component checklist alone. Name the actual
React S2 source files, expected state attributes, target accessible roles, and
the exact query/state URLs to open in Playwright. If a row cannot be tested yet,
record why and mark it as a tracked gap in the visual state matrix.

If the component contains icons, the plan must include explicit React-vs-Solid
icon alignment checks. Do not rely on visual memory. Inspect the React Spectrum
reference and the Solid implementation in the browser, capture both sides, and
record the box/centerline/baseline measurements before accepting the state. The
minimum icon matrix is start, end, icon-only, pending-with-icon, and each
supported size that changes button height.

## Button-Family Batch Plan

Process button-family components in small batches, but sign off each component
individually. Batch 1 covers single button-derived controls:
`ActionButton`, `ToggleButton`, and `LinkButton`.

| Assumption                                                                                                           | React S2 reference to inspect                                                                                                            | Solid surface to inspect                                                                                                                                      | Browser check                                                                                                                                                    | Committed guard                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ActionButton text, icon-leading, icon-only, size, quiet, staticColor, disabled, and pending states match S2 geometry | `@react-spectrum/s2/src/ActionButton.tsx`, especially `btnStyles`, `IconContext`, `TextContext`, `usePendingState`, and `ProgressCircle` | `packages/solid-spectrum/src/button/ActionButton.tsx`, `s2-action-button-styles.ts`, comparison route `/components/actionbutton/?iconPlacement=start&size=XL` | Compare React/Solid root, icon, text, gap, progress, and centerline boxes in Playwright; inspect delayed pending with icon content after spinner becomes visible | `e2e/actionbutton-visual.spec.ts` computed, screenshot, icon geometry, and pending-with-icon tests        |
| ToggleButton icon content and selected state use the same baseline and accessible pressed state                      | `@react-spectrum/s2/src/ToggleButton.tsx`, `btnStyles`, `ToggleButtonGroupContext`, `IconContext`, `TextContext`                         | `packages/solid-spectrum/src/button/ToggleButton.tsx`, route `/components/togglebutton/?iconPlacement=start&isSelected=true`                                  | Compare root/icon/text boxes, aria-pressed, and selected-state rendering for text+icon and icon-only                                                             | `e2e/single-button-controls-visual.spec.ts` screenshots, geometry assertions, and selected-state contract |
| LinkButton preserves link semantics while using Button visual/icon treatment                                         | `@react-spectrum/s2/src/Button.tsx` `LinkButton`, `button`, `IconContext`, `TextContext`                                                 | `packages/solid-spectrum/src/button/LinkButton.tsx`, route `/components/linkbutton/?iconPlacement=only`                                                       | Compare anchor role/name/href, root/icon/text boxes, and icon-only accessible name                                                                               | `e2e/single-button-controls-visual.spec.ts` screenshots, geometry assertions, and href contract           |

Batch 1 intentionally leaves group context and collection selection details to
Batch 2 and Batch 3. Do not mix group fixes into single-control work unless a
shared button primitive regression blocks the single-control matrix.

## Playwright CLI Inspection

Use Playwright CLI for exploratory browser validation before accepting a visual
fix. The test suite is the committed guard; CLI inspection is how we catch
layout details before the user has to point them out.

Required loop for visual fixes:

1. Start the comparison app.
2. Open the component route with the intended query state.
3. Take an accessibility/DOM snapshot.
4. Capture React and Solid screenshots into `output/playwright/`.
5. For alignment-sensitive states, capture geometry from both sides and compare
   root, icon, text, and slot rectangles.
6. Use video or tracing when the state is temporal, such as pressed, pending, or
   overlay animation.
7. Promote the useful assertion into `apps/comparison/e2e` before calling the
   component fixed.

Example artifacts:

```bash
export CODEX_HOME="${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}"
export PWCLI="$CODEX_HOME/skills/playwright/scripts/playwright_cli.sh"
"$PWCLI" open http://127.0.0.1:4321/components/button/?iconPlacement=start --headed
"$PWCLI" snapshot
"$PWCLI" screenshot --output output/playwright/button-icon-start.png
```

## Screenshot Rule

Screenshots validate implementation. They do not define implementation.

If a screenshot fails, inspect the S2 style declaration and Solid style-system
output before changing CSS.
